\noindent ThermoSight is developed for an easy-to-use thermal inspection system, specifically designed for civil-engineering materials to overcome challenges that manual infrared surveys and subjective interpretations face. Traditional thermography may not always be reliable due to emissivity variations and lack of automated analysis. Thus, this system leverages a Vision Transformer model to classify temperature bands accurately and generates heatmap visualisations to make thermal anomalies more understandable to inspectors. The system prioritizes material-specific emissivity correction while addressing limitations of fixed-threshold methods. Another feature that improves safety and efficiency is real-time AI-driven classification, which provides rapid, explainable results with minimal latency. Combining these elements, the goal is to create an effortless, reliable, user-centric thermal diagnostics experience for infrastructure maintenance teams.
